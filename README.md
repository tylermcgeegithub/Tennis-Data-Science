# Tennis-Data-Science
All of my code and functions for Data Science / Machine Learning for Tennis Match Outcome Prediction
I'm attaching a file called ML_Tennis
This file was my first attempt at using a logistic regresssion machine learning model on tennis data
I took data from 3 500 level ATP events, which was 93 matches
I made a train/test split of this data so that 19 matches were saved for testing and 74 were using for training
